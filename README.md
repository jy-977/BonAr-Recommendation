## Purpose of the project
1. To contribute the sales rate of Bon Ar**, we suggest 3 solutions to recommend products from customer's purchasing record.
2. As a project of Data Mining course of [Universitat de Lleida](https://masterinformatica.udl.cat/es/), We design and implement the 3 different of recommendation system using **FP-Growth**, **Collaborative Filtering**, **Neural Network**
3. We deal with actual selling data during 2019 - 2020 year from Bon AR** which has more than 500 stores in Catalonia.
