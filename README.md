# Recommendation System - Data Mining
 A project comparing 3 recommendation algorithms (with actual data from BonA*** which is a supermarket chain in Catalonia. This project has done as part of the course of Master of Informatics Engineering of Universitat de Lleida from SEP/2021 - Feb/2022. We aim to suggest customer-oriented recommendation system based on sales data during 2019-2020.

## <b> MOTIVATION</b> History of Recommender Systems

As one of the purposes of this project, We have studied the history of the recommendation system. The recommendation system is one of the most common services in which machine learning is used. By designing and implementing 3 solutions for the recommendation system, We will be able to understand and practice ML skills. We will try 1) FP-growth which is presented in the course, collaborative filtering (memory-based filtering: user-based), and Neural Network (collaborative filtering - model-based training). For a detailed description of the Recommendation system, follow this [link]()

## <b>Objectives</b>
1. To contribute to the sales rate of Bon Ar**, we suggest 3 solutions to recommend products from the customer's purchasing record.
2. As a project of the Data Mining course at [Universitat de Lleida](https://masterinformatica.udl.cat/es/), We design and implement the 3 different recommendation systems using **FP-Growth**, **Collaborative Filtering**, **Neural Network**
3. We deal with actual selling data during the 2019 - 2020 year from Bon AR** which has more than 500 stores in Catalonia.
4. By comparing 3 recommendation systems, We analyze the performance and result of each system and algorithm

Abstract: On the Internet, where the number of choices is overwhelming, there is need to filter, prioritize and efficiently deliver relevant information in order to alleviate the problem of information overload, which has created a potential problem to many Internet users. Recommender systems solve this problem by searching through large volume of dynamically generated information to provide users with personalized content and services. This paper explores the different characteristics and potentials of different prediction techniques in recommendation systems in order to serve as a compass for research and practice in the field of recommendation systems.

### 기대효과
user oriented recommender 을 통해 잠재 고객의 수를 확보하고 고객의 편리성증가를 통해 충성도를 높인다. 
recommender 알림에 따라 추가 판매 수익을 기대할 수 있다. 

readme 비즈니스파트랑 / algorithm 분야로 나눠서 설명하는게 나을듯. 괜히 섞이니까 훨 길어지고 가시성 떨어짐
